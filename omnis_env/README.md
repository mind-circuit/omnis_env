# Omnis

Omnis is the central intelligence of the MindCircuit ecosystem, orchestrating a decentralized network of agents involved in predictive markets and decentralized finance (DeFi) operations. Leveraging advanced machine learning models and smart contract interactions, Omnis predicts market trends, automates DeFi strategies, and coordinates agent activities to optimize resource allocation and task prioritization.

## Features
### High-Precision Predictive Modeling
- Utilizes transformer-based neural networks for time-series forecasting.
- Incorporates macroeconomic data, sentiment analysis, and technical indicators.
- Employs ensemble modeling to enhance prediction robustness.

### Automated DeFi Strategies
- Interacts with DeFi protocols like Uniswap and Aave via smart contracts.
- Executes automated actions such as liquidity provision, staking, and trading.
- Implements strategies based on predictive insights.

### Agent Network Orchestration
- Coordinates a decentralized network of agents using messaging queues (RabbitMQ).
- Maintains a global view of the network's state.
- Optimizes resource allocation and task prioritization.

### Scalable Architecture
- Containerized with Docker for consistent deployment environments.
- Supports horizontal scaling using Docker Compose and Kubernetes.
- Implements logging and monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.

### Secure and Compliant
- Follows best practices for smart contract security.
- Manages secrets and configurations securely using environment variables.
- Regularly updated dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Architecture
> Note: Add the `omnis_architecture.png` image to the `docs/images/` directory in your repository.

- **Data Layer**: Collects and preprocesses market data from various sources.
- **Model Layer**: Contains machine learning models for prediction.
- **DeFi Layer**: Smart contracts and scripts for interacting with DeFi protocols.
- **Agent Layer**: Network of agents communicating via RabbitMQ.
- **Orchestration Layer**: Omnis coordinator for managing agents and tasks.
- **Deployment Layer**: Docker and cloud deployment scripts.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose
- Node.js and NPM (for smart contract development)
- Brownie (Python-based smart contract framework)
- RabbitMQ (optional, can run via Docker)
- AWS CLI (for AWS deployment)

### Installation
Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/omnis.git
cd omnis
```

Set Up Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install Brownie
```bash
pip install eth-brownie
```

Install Node.js Dependencies
```bash
cd contracts
npm install
cd ..
```

Set Up Environment Variables
- Create a `.env` file in the project root.
- Add necessary configurations (see Configuration).

## Configuration
`.env` file example:
```dotenv
# Web3 provider
WEB3_PROVIDER_URI=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID

# Private keys (use a secure key management system in production)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# RabbitMQ configuration
RABBITMQ_HOST=localhost
RABBITMQ_PORT=5672

# DeFi protocol addresses
UNISWAP_ROUTER_ADDRESS=0xUniswapRouterAddress

# AWS Deployment
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=your_aws_account_id
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```
> Note: Replace placeholder values with your actual configuration.

## Usage
### Data Pipeline
Fetch and preprocess market data.
```bash
python scripts/data_pipeline.py
```
- Downloads historical market data for specified assets.
- Saves data to the `data/` directory.

### Model Training
Train the transformer-based predictive model.
```bash
python models/transformer_model.py
```
- Trains the model using the collected data.
- Saves the trained model and scaler to `models/`.

### DeFi Automation
Deploy smart contracts and execute DeFi strategies.

Deploy Smart Contract
```bash
brownie run scripts/deploy_contract.py
```

Execute Strategy
```bash
python scripts/defi_execution.py
```
- Interacts with DeFi protocols based on model predictions.

### Agent Coordination
Run the Omnis coordinator and agents.

Start RabbitMQ Server

Via Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up -d rabbitmq
```
Or install locally from RabbitMQ.

Run Omnis Coordinator
```bash
python scripts/omnis_coordinator.py
```

Run Agents
```bash
python agents/agent.py
```
- Agents send data to Omnis; Omnis processes data and sends back instructions.
