Features
High-Precision Predictive Modeling

Utilizes transformer-based neural networks for time-series forecasting.
Incorporates macroeconomic data, sentiment analysis, and technical indicators.
Employs ensemble modeling to enhance prediction robustness.
Automated DeFi Strategies

Interacts with DeFi protocols like Uniswap and Aave via smart contracts.
Executes automated actions such as liquidity provision, staking, and trading.
Implements strategies based on predictive insights.
Agent Network Orchestration

Coordinates a decentralized network of agents using messaging queues (RabbitMQ).
Maintains a global view of the network's state.
Optimizes resource allocation and task prioritization.
Scalable Architecture

Containerized with Docker for consistent deployment environments.
Supports horizontal scaling using Docker Compose and Kubernetes.
Implements logging and monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
Secure and Compliant

Follows best practices for smart contract security.
Manages secrets and configurations securely using environment variables.
Regularly updated dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities.
Architecture

Note: Add the omnis_architecture.png image to the docs/images/ directory in your repository.

Data Layer: Collects and preprocesses market data from various sources.
Model Layer: Contains machine learning models for prediction.
DeFi Layer: Smart contracts and scripts for interacting with DeFi protocols.
Agent Layer: Network of agents communicating via RabbitMQ.
Orchestration Layer: Omnis coordinator for managing agents and tasks.
Deployment Layer: Docker and cloud deployment scripts.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Docker Engine
Docker Compose
Node.js and NPM (for smart contract development)
Brownie (Python-based smart contract framework)
RabbitMQ (optional, can run via Docker)
AWS CLI (for AWS deployment)
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone 
cd omnis
Set Up Virtual Environment

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install Brownie

bash
Copy code
pip install eth-brownie
Install Node.js Dependencies

bash
Copy code
cd contracts
npm install
cd ..
Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root.
Add necessary configurations (see Configuration).
Configuration
.env file example:

dotenv
Copy code
# Web3 provider
WEB3_PROVIDER_URI=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID

# Private keys (use a secure key management system in production)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# RabbitMQ configuration
RABBITMQ_HOST=localhost
RABBITMQ_PORT=5672

# DeFi protocol addresses
UNISWAP_ROUTER_ADDRESS=0xUniswapRouterAddress

# AWS Deployment
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=your_aws_account_id
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
Note: Replace placeholder values with your actual configuration.

Usage
Data Pipeline
Fetch and preprocess market data.

bash
Copy code
python scripts/data_pipeline.py
Downloads historical market data for specified assets.
Saves data to the data/ directory.
Model Training
Train the transformer-based predictive model.

bash
Copy code
python models/transformer_model.py
Trains the model using the collected data.
Saves the trained model and scaler to models/.
DeFi Automation
Deploy smart contracts and execute DeFi strategies.

Deploy Smart Contract

bash
Copy code
brownie run scripts/deploy_contract.py
Execute Strategy

bash
Copy code
python scripts/defi_execution.py
Interacts with DeFi protocols based on model predictions.
Agent Coordination
Run the Omnis coordinator and agents.

Start RabbitMQ Server

Via Docker:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d rabbitmq
Or install locally from RabbitMQ.

Run Omnis Coordinator

bash
Copy code
python scripts/omnis_coordinator.py
Run Agents

bash
Copy code
python agents/agent.py
Agents send data to Omnis; Omnis processes data and sends back instructions.
